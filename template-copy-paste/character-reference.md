## Legal characters in HMT editions

The Greek text of your edition may use the following characters.

### Alphabetic characters

You may use alphabetic α-ω in upper or lower case.  They characters may be combined with accents and/or breathings in the Unicode Greek range.  As part of our validation process, different Unicode forms (such as modern Greek vowel + tonos versus ancient Greek vowel + acute accent) will be normalized to a single standard representation (technically, Unicode normalization form C in the extended Greek range).


### Punctuation

The following characters are used to encode punctuation:

-   period = `.`
-   comma = `,`
-   interrogation mark = `;`
-   high stop = `-` (hyphen)
-   "end-of-scholion/unit" marker:  `⁑` (Unicode U+2015)
-   "large unit divider":  `‡` (Unicode U+2021)


### Quantity

-   macron = `_` (underscore)
-   breve = `^`

### "Floating" characters

Our manuscripts sometimes create combinations of accents, breathings and other marks that we do not encounter in modern typeset Greek, and that cannot be encoded with Unicode characters.  In those cases where you may need to add an additional diacritic character, use the following encodings:

-   "floating" acute accent =  `/`
-   "floating" grave accent =  `\`
-   "floating" diaeresis =  `+`
